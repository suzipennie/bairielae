                            <p>My save files all got corrupt from using the same save file so much I believe and now none will load. I went into the files deleted all the save files and then uninstalled the game. When I reinstalled the game the save files were all still there and now they won't go away. I'm using the steam edition of the game if that helps. Before I was using Killaps restoration project Update 1: I finally was able to delete the save files by deleting all the slots and disabling steam cloud so it doesn't. I recently got Fallout 2 from steam, and installed Killap's Restoration project, but i am unable to properly play. after some time, i start getting errors saying the instruction at X referenced memory from Y The memory could not be read. the values X and Y change often, though the most common i found are 004f11db for X and 00000010 for Y. editing the Draw.ini file has changed how often these errors happen but i am completely stuck on what to do, and any advice or help is appreciated, Thanks. Think about it, Fallout 4 has been turned into a survival simulator(FROST), an actual RPG (Fallout Cascadia), a completely new game(Fallout Lone Star). Fallout New Vegas, the best 3D Fallout is being turned into a Fallout 2 like experience(New California), an FPS (The Frontier). Fallout 2 has such amazing mods as Fallout Online, Fallout of Nevada, Fallout 1.5: Resurrection, Fallout: Last Hope, Killap's Restoration Project etc. With Obsidian never getting a chance to make another Fallout Hey guys! At 8 pm PST, I'm going to be streaming Fallout 2. I'll be rolling a new character. He'll have to shoot, glitch, and talk his way through the challenges of the wasteland. By 3 lives, I mean a softer version of Ironman. You know how cats have 9 lives? My chosen one is gonna have 3. Any reloading of an old save counts as a "death". It gives a nice compromise between ending the run because of an unlucky crit, and still maintaining the tense atmosphere that Ironman runs have! sorry its another one of these posts. I really want to do my annual f2 play through again(I'm an idiot for deleting it in the first place). The game runs realllllllllly slow and has bad mouse lag; Even with the high res patch and killap's restoration project. I some how had evga precision turned on and i was getting like 3 fps in the world map. tried deleting the ddraw.dll file and still no improvement. So im going to try again with a fresh install, any help would be great. I wasnt able to do the fight with Frank perfectly as people have said before (Convince Enclave soldiers, hack the turrets). I only managed to convince the soldiers to help me fight Frank Horrigan, but I could not hack the turrets with the Presidential Key. Login only gave me the option ro go back because no user id was present, so with much frustration I just faced Frank Horrigan with the turrets anyway. Also another problem I had was fighting frank horrigan himself. ALL my weapons Hello beautiful people! This guide is going to assume that you use Windows 7, have the GoG US version of Fallout 2, patched to the most recent version, and with Killap's Restoration Project successfully installed. I am certain that it will work on other setups, but I've only tested my setup. You'll need to know your Fallout 2 installation directory and have permission to modify files within it. Within your installation directory, the Restoration Project will have installed a document named. 
So I am playing Fallout 2 again, with killaps restoration project patch applied. I'm already pretty much done again, but I have now run into trouble: In order to fix the tanker, you need to get chips spleen back, so the others (specifically the captain, but also badger) will trust you. Problem is, I forgot about the quest timer and long ago did other quests - and now that I have returned (and gotten his spleen back and the doc ready) chip has died. Now, I can't get Badger Hey guys! At 8 pm PST, I'm going to be streaming Fallout 2. I'll be rolling a new character. He'll have to shoot, glitch, and talk his way through the challenges of the wasteland. This isn't a true Ironman run; our dearest chosen one will have 3 lives to complete the game. Any loading of a save counts, so no dodging bad RNG. Gotta live with the consequences. I'm a complete masochist, so we'll be setting the difficulty for combat to rough, and the roleplaying difficulty to normal. I'm at home for Christmas with my laptop (a Macbook) and I thought I'd give Fallout 2 a go. However, I can't find a way to get Killap's Restoration Project (as opposed to his patch) working with the Mac version. I have been able to extract all the files that comes with it into their various different locations but the final part of the manual installation involves running an executable file (master_dat_fix.exe) to modify the master.dat file. Without having done this, but with all the other. For reference, I have killaps restoration project installed. But, like I said, when I enter the powerplant in gecko there isn't any sort of machine or anything that I could use the magnetosphere regulator on, just some rotting boxes and some pipes. I'd post a screenshot, but it's just coming up black in paint. Hey /r/Fallout. I'm an old school Fallout player. Started with Fallout 1 nearly a decade ago and just recently decided to try out the newer Fallout games by starting with New Vegas (it interested me the most.) I'm near the end of my first play through now and was wanting to do my second run with some cool mods. Not looking for bigger breasts mods or crap like that. But I was wondering if New Vegas had an equivalent to Killap's Restoration Project / Unofficial Fallout 2 patch? Because I just started and did my usual leave Arroyo for a Navarro run and once I got about midway to San Fran, I started getting near constant encounters. Geckos, Spore Plants, Aliens, Deathclaw packs, Press Gangs, etc. Pretty much getting slaughtered like crazy on the way, but somehow managed to make it. Now I'm trying to leave with a handful of stimpacks and a 44 magnum revolver, but I'm just getting destroyed by Press gangs the moment I leave SF. I'm going to be fucking amazed if I manage. Just completed fallout 1 and I am now continuing on to Fallout 2. But the no container highlight is a problem. Sfall has it and using it I can see that i missed 2 containers in the temple alone. Unfortunately the game crashes with both sfall and Killap's Fallout 2 Restoration Project installed. includes new locations, new followers, a big follower story mission for Sulik, lots of new missions, adds back in some unused/speech pack, creates some brand new professional quality speech pack, several alternate side quest completion methods, and much more. This is an expansion of the original game. It is not a sequel so it is OK for 1st time playthroughs. edited because evidently I haven't begun to explore the amount of added material. 
If so, should I back up saves just in case? I have the steam version of Fallout 2. I'm getting the unofficial patch now because I wasn't aware of the bug in which you can't negotiate a treaty with Tandi after clearing vault 15. If anyone knows if this patch fixes that bug, please Hi, I'm not sure if this has been discussed here before, as I'm not really a frequent visitor to reddit, but I think it's important enough to warrant a new mention even if it has been talked about before. I love Fallout 2 to bits, it's easily one of my favourite games of all time, but it is also unfortunately really buggy. And the fan patch helps with a great many bugs, some small and some rather big ones as well. As I understand. I've bought the game in the Steam sale and am not sure what changes it makes to the game. EDIT: I've downloaded Killap's unofficial patch but not the restoration project which I am happy with for now, I will download the restoration project at a later date, however I can't install the patch because Fallout 2 is installed in the c:\programs directory and it is asking me to install it elsewhere, does anyone know where is ideal to install it elsewhere. i have played fallout 2 before, with killaps patch and when my steal skill was high it was unlikely to ever get caught. i recently had to reset my pc so i installed the game and the restoration project again, but this time i get caught much more often. i even used a save editor to put my steal to over 300% and i still get caught once every 4 people or something crazy like that. does anyone know the fix to this? amp#x200B. If you have a look at Killap's website, you'll see two download options there: Unofficial Fallout 2 patch, that has HD-patch and bug fixes in it, and Restoration project. Does the latter include goodies from the "Unofficial Fallout 2 patch"? I mean, if I wanna play Restoration project, should I install Unofficial Fallout 2 patch first? Thanks. First a little background. For those who don't know, the Fallout 2 Restoration Project is a popular Fallout 2 mod lead by killap which seeks to add in a whole bunch of content that the original Fallout 2 developers had at some point considered including in the game but never fully implemented. It was about a decade ago that killap brought me on board to design and write the dialogue for one of the RP's new recruitable NPC followers. I created Dex, and killap was impressed enough with my writing. Hi, i'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for help regarding the game, but i'll give it a shot as i can't find resolution anywhere. I'm currently in Klamath, and i can't enter the Golden Gecko. In front of the open door stands a bar patron, who doesn't move out of the way and makes remarks about the character not being allowed in "Better mind your own business, Why don't you go somewhere else?" etc. I can't find any example of him being around watching footage of Fallout 2 or reading. 
I specifically installed the unofficial patch for this. In the vanilla game, I was able to destroy the doors with my bare hands, however, the Rangers didn't acknowledge the fact. The patch ( ( \-- NOT the restoration project) tells that now you can destroy the doors in NCR as well. So I tried. I was able to blow two doors open with a desert eagle, three more doors Fixes for all fallout games listed below. Please read everything for your game before asking a question This post has been archived, so feel free to send me a PM if you need help We get a lot of requests for bug and crash help on /r/fallout, so point people here when they ask for help. I will remain active in the comments for people who need help. For all games, Ensure you have your Audio and Video drivers up to date! before asking for help, make sure your computer meets. Right, me again. This shit is kind of addicting because you people say such nice things, which really is the best motivation one could get. Besides, it helps sobering me up if I do one of those every day.
